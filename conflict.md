# Conflict demo

This is file is basically to demonstrate a conflict.

> Merge conflicts occurs when two (or more) modifications (made by yourself or others) are made to the same line of a file. This causes a state of confusion as Git is unsure which change should be applied. So rather than making a decision for you, it "errors" and lets you decide.
